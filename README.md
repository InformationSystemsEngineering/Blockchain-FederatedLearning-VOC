# Advancing Blockchain-based Federated Learning through Verifiable Off-chain Computations

In this paper _(currently under review)_, we explore verifiable off-chain computations (VOC) using zero-knowledge proofs as an alternative to incentive and penalty mechanisms in blockchain-based federated learning.
